# Network Anomaly Detection Model
Supervised learning ML algorithm built with logistic regression and data augmentation to detect DDoS attacks.

Algorithm was run on the HIKARI-2022 dataset which is a network intrusion detection dataset designed for network anomaly detection research.
It contains both benign and malicious traffic, including encrypted synthetic attacks. The dataset is significantly imbalanced (93% benign vs. 7% malicious), influencing our decision to conduct data augmentation on the malicious cases. HIKARI-2022 can be downloaded from Zenodo.

Please check the writeup for implementation details.
